                After a week, another friend of Clara, Maxie contacted her. She knew Clara long enough, and asked her why she has been conversing with her other friends and sharing cringy photos. That did not seem like something Clara would be comfortable with. 
                Clara finds out what has been happening, and is absolutely horrified. How could Amy do this to her?!

                        Clara decides to report the situation to a school counsellor. She knows that outing and trickery can have serious consequences and that she needs to take action to protect herself. The counsellor listens attentively and offers some advice:
                        *"Clara, it sounds like you're going through a tough time. I'm sorry to hear that Amy has been sharing your photos without your consent. This is a serious matter, and we need to take it seriously. I will speak to Amy and her parents about what has been happening and make sure that she understands the impact of her actions. In the meantime, I suggest that you take a break from social media and focus on your studies and your well-being. Remember, you are not alone, and we are here to support you."*
                        Clara feels relieved after talking to the counsellor and knows that she has taken the right step in seeking help. She takes a break from social media and focuses on her studies and her hobbies. Over time, she begins to feel better and more confident in herself.
