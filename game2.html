                        Clara decides not to tell her mother about the situation. She thinks that it's not a big deal and that she can handle it on her own. However, as the days go by, Clara becomes increasingly anxious and stressed. 
                        She can't concentrate in school and feels like everyone is talking about her behind her back.

                        Clara decides to open up to her mother about what happened at school and how she's been feeling since then. Her mother listens attentively, offering comfort and understanding. After Clara finishes sharing her story, her mother offers some advice:
                        "Clara, it sounds like there might be a misunderstanding between you and Amy. I think it's important for you to talk to her and express how her actions have made you feel. Remember, good communication is key in any friendship. Try to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and hopefully, you can work things out together."
                        Feeling a little better after talking to her mother, Clara decides to have a conversation with Amy the next day. She wants to understand why Amy shared those photos and how they can move forward as friends. Clara's mother assures her that she's always there to support her, no matter what happens.
